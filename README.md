# AI Course Final Project

This project serves as the culmination of my AI coursework:
  -  Part 1: Object Detection
  -  Part 2: Focusing on analyzing Tesla-related incidents using machine learning techniques.


## üìÇ Repository Structure

- **Notebooks**:
  - `Capstone_01_part_1.ipynb`: Object Detection, locaing vehicles from security camera photos.
  - `Capstone_01_part_2.ipynb`: Model development, evaluation, and conclusions.
- **Data**:
  - `Tesla - Deaths.csv`: Contains data on Tesla-related incidents resulting in fatalities.
  - `labels.csv`: Provides labels for Part 1.
- **Configuration**:
  - `requirements.txt`: Lists Python packages required to run the notebooks.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tybreen/AI-Course-Final-Project.git
   ```

2. Install Dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Notebooks:

   Open the Jupyter notebooks `Capstone_01_part_1.ipynb` and `Capstone_01_part_2.ipynb` to explore the analysis and findings.

## üîç Project Overview

 This project was my final project for my Fullstack AI/Machine learning Boot Camp. The first part of the project was object detection using security camera photos that were provided, and the second part of the project was analyzing Tesla related deaths from a dataset that we were given as well.
